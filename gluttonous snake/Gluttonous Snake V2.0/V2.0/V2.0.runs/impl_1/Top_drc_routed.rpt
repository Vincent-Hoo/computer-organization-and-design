2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CFGBVS-1#1 Warning
Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties  
Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Button/button_plus is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Button/direct[1]_i_2/O, cell Button/direct[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Game/mode_reg[0]/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Game/mode_reg[0]/L3_2/O, cell Game/mode_reg[0]/L3_2 (in Game/mode_reg[0] macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Game/mode_reg[1]_i_1_n_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Game/mode_reg[1]_i_1/O, cell Game/mode_reg[1]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net Snake/plus is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Snake/cubenum[3]_i_2/O, cell Snake/cubenum[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT Button/direct[1]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    Snake/direct_reg[0] {FDRE}
    Snake/direct_reg[1] {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#2 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT Snake/cubenum[3]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    Snake/cubenum_reg[3] {FDSE}
    Snake/cubenum_reg[1] {FDSE}
    Snake/cubenum_reg[0] {FDSE}
    Snake/cubenum_reg[2] {FDSE}

Related violations: <none>
