WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PDRC-153) Gated clock check - Net Snake/plus is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin Snake/cubenum[3]_i_2/O, cell Snake/cubenum[3]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT Button/direct[1]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 2 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    Snake/direct_reg[0] {FDRE}
    Snake/direct_reg[1] {FDRE}

WARNING: [DRC 23-20] Rule violation (PLHOLDVIO-2) Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations - A LUT Snake/cubenum[3]_i_2 is driving clock pin of 4 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    Snake/cubenum_reg[3] {FDSE}
    Snake/cubenum_reg[1] {FDSE}
    Snake/cubenum_reg[0] {FDSE}
    Snake/cubenum_reg[2] {FDSE}
